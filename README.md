# Flask CRUD App with MongoDB

This project is a simple Flask application to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MongoDB database for users. It has a REST API that lets you manage users by making HTTP requests. You can test the API using Postman.

## What’s in This Project
- **CRUD Operations**: You can add, view, update, and delete users.
- **MongoDB Database**: All user data is stored in MongoDB.
- **REST API Endpoints**: There are different URLs for each operation.
- **Dockerized**: This means you can set up everything with Docker (an easy way to run applications).
- **Postman Testing**: Test each function with Postman.

## User Data Structure
Each user has:
- `id` (auto-generated by MongoDB)
- `name` (name of the user)
- `email` (unique email for each user)
- `password` (user’s password)

## REST API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint       | Description                         |
|--------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/users`       | Get a list of all users             |
| GET    | `/users/<id>`  | Get a single user by ID             |
| POST   | `/users`       | Add a new user                      |
| PUT    | `/users/<id>`  | Update an existing user             |
| DELETE | `/users/<id>`  | Delete a user by ID                 |

## Tools Used
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building the API.
- **PyMongo**: Lets Flask talk to MongoDB.
- **Docker**: Packages everything so it runs the same everywhere.
- **Postman**: Tool to test each URL easily.
